# Rera_Scapper
A robust Python script using Selenium to scrape project details directly from project cards on the Odisha RERA website, extracting key information (RERA No., Project Name, Promoter Name, Address) and saving it to a CSV file. The script is designed for reliability, avoiding navigation to detail pages and focusing only on the essential fields.
